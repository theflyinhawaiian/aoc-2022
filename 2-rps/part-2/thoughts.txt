So this doesn't change too much from part 1. Instead of checking what our choice is, we check to see what the result is and pass along the corresponding math.

To that end, we make a new dictionary for the results, and remove them from our actions dictionary:

    values = { "A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3 }
    results = { "X": -1, "Y": 0, "Z": 1 }

Now, the modifications to our processScore method:

    # I've renamed the variables to be more descriptive
    def processScore(throw, result):
        # the draw case remains super similar to the first iteration
        if(result == 0):
            return 3 + throw

        if(throw == 1):
            if(result == 1):
                return 8
            else:
                return 3
        elif(throw == 2):
            if(result == 1):
                return 9
            else:
                return 1
        elif(throw == 3):
            if(result == 1):
                return 7
            else:
                return 2

man, that looks so familiar, it's spooky.

...aaaand it works. This one almost feels easier than day 1.
